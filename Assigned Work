These are the functions that we have to modify/implement:

(These all need to be implemented first, Bryan and Kit will work on them)
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_lw
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_sw
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_branch
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_jump
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_syscall
iplc_sim_process_pipeline_nop

(These will be implemented after the previous six, since they are dependent on those first six)
iplc_sim_LRU_replace_on_miss - John
iplc_sim_trap_address - Lee
iplc_sim_push_pipeline_stage - Sarah

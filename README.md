Comp Org Group Project, Fall 2016 
<br />
What I did - John Marvin:
<br />
For our project, we broke down what code needed to be filled in into nine parts. Six of these parts we deemed "easy", or at least easier than the other three. We then assigned one of the three "hard" parts to a separate group member, I did LRU replace on miss. The other two were push pipepline stage and trap address. The six easy were divided in half and each half was assigned to a single group member. We then all collaborated to debug and test the filled in code.
